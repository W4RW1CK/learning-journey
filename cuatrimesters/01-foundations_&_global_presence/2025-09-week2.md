## 💭 Reflections & Next Steps  

**What went well:**  
- *Linux Survival* — An incredible interactive game that really helped me understand how to navigate in the CLI world.
- *Learning branching* — A great visual way to grasp Git branches; it’s awesome.

**What was challenging:**
- *Bandit* — OverTheWire created an amazing game. I’m currently stuck on level 12, but hey, I’ll find a way out. (I’m really in love with this type of games and challenges.)

**Reflections:**
This was a really interesting week in which I solidified my comfort with the Linux CLI and Git basics. I moved from simply following commands (often without knowing exactly what they were supposed to do) to truly understanding why each step matters, and I began applying them in my own environment. The combination of reading, interactive practice, and real‑world application made the concepts stick.
In addition, I started setting up a Fedora Server at home. Why? There are several projects I want to run: first, installing Pi‑hole; then using it as a node in my Syncthing network; and eventually hosting many more self‑hosted services.  

**Next Steps (Week 3 Preview — Networking & Crypto Fundamentals):**
Next week I’ll shift focus to networking and cryptography. The plan includes:  
- Deep dive into the OSI model and diagramming it in Markdown  
- Learning TCP/IP, ports, and sockets, plus packet sniffing with `tcpdump`/Wireshark  
- Understanding HTTP/TLS and writing a blog post “TLS in Plain English”  
- Implementing hashing algorithms (SHA‑256, Blake2) in Python  
- Exploring AES basics, PKI concepts, and encrypting/decrypting files in Python  

I’m thinking of creating an entry at the beginning of the week and adding resources and progress each day. Let’s see how that goes next week. Until then, that’s all — see you soon.
